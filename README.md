# Fuga di Penitenziaria

This repository holds all the files related to the game that Lis Dautaj, Alejandro Pacheco, and myself worked on together as part of a 1-credit hour course offered jointly by the Department of Italian Studies and the Department of Computer Science (IDS 290R) at Emory University. Our main task was to make a game that would serve as a learning supplement to students who are taking ITAL 101 (the first introductory class in Italian language).

The platform we used for this project was Twine, which made it easy for both the computer science students and the Italian studies student to change and alter the game along the way.

The game is still a work-in-progress, and this repository will be uploaded weekly with new changes.
